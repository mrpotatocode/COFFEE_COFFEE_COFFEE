# This is a subsection of COFFEE_COFFEE_COFFEE: Discussions



This contains:

* The [Project's Plan](https://github.com/mrpotatocode/COFFEE_COFFEE_COFFEE/blob/main/Discussions/plan.md)
* The [Coffee Paper](https://github.com/mrpotatocode/COFFEE_COFFEE_COFFEE/blob/main/Discussions/coffee%20paper.pdf) as a PDF.
* The [Coffee Paper](https://github.com/mrpotatocode/COFFEE_COFFEE_COFFEE/blob/main/Discussions/coffee%20paper.Rmd) as a RMD.
  * Underlying scripts can be found here:
    * [Build](https://github.com/mrpotatocode/COFFEE_COFFEE_COFFEE/tree/main/scripts/build)
    * [Analyze](https://github.com/mrpotatocode/COFFEE_COFFEE_COFFEE/tree/main/scripts/analyze) 
* The paper's supporting files [bibtex](https://github.com/mrpotatocode/COFFEE_COFFEE_COFFEE/blob/main/Discussions/references.bib) and [images](https://github.com/mrpotatocode/COFFEE_COFFEE_COFFEE/tree/main/Discussions/imgs), [banner](https://github.com/mrpotatocode/COFFEE_COFFEE_COFFEE/blob/main/Discussions/mrpotatocode_banner.png)
* The paper's current static [dataset](https://github.com/mrpotatocode/COFFEE_COFFEE_COFFEE/tree/main/Discussions/data). This allows the paper to be reproduced at the time I wrote it. The dataset can be [recreated](https://github.com/mrpotatocode/COFFEE_COFFEE_COFFEE/blob/main/scripts/multi_stacked_model.Rmd) at any point with new data, and the paper rerun. Paper results will be updated.
* An [introductory presentation](https://github.com/mrpotatocode/COFFEE_COFFEE_COFFEE/blob/main/Discussions/context-inspiration-scraping-plans.pptx) made _before_ the project was completed
