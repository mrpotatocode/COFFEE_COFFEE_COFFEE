## Weekly Reflection: Getting Started

Things are started!
I've built a scraper for data on Eight Ounce Coffee's (website)[https://eightouncecoffee.ca/]. I've focused on Coffee's from The Library Speciality Coffee (TLS) here in Toronto.

The basic concept is:

- Grab the names of this week's TLS coffees
- Get the details of each of those coffees
  - Fortunate to see that names are easily translated into a hyperlink(.../Ethopia-Sidma-Washed/)
- Build a table with the types of relevent 


|       | Roaster                      | Country | Region | Variety  | Process | Tasting Notes             |
|-------|------------------------------|---------|--------|----------|---------|---------------------------|
| 1     | The Library Specialty Coffee | Ethopia | Sidma  | Heirloom | Washed  | Peach, Blackberry, Floral |

More later.
