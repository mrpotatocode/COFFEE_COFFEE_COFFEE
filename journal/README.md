# This is a subsection of COFFEE_COFFEE_COFFEE: (near) Weekly Journaling

These journals describe the various concepts learned/implemented/overcome during the course of this project. They are written to be casual and reflective. Most of these are already linked on the top page README by their various topics. Each folder contains both a knit markdown and an rmarkdown file for code.

* Week 1: [Getting Started](https://github.com/mrpotatocode/COFFEE_COFFEE_COFFEE/blob/main/journal/Week1/Week1.md) 
* Week 2: [Literature, Basic Shiny Concepts](https://github.com/mrpotatocode/COFFEE_COFFEE_COFFEE/blob/main/journal/Week2/Week2.md)
* Week 3: [Scraping](https://github.com/mrpotatocode/COFFEE_COFFEE_COFFEE/blob/main/journal/Week3/Week3.md)
* Week 4: [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/mrpotatocode/COFFEE_COFFEE_COFFEE/blob/main/journal/Week4/Week4.md)
* Week 5: [First Shiny App](https://github.com/mrpotatocode/COFFEE_COFFEE_COFFEE/blob/main/journal/Week5/Week5.md)
* Week 7: [Tidy Models](https://github.com/mrpotatocode/COFFEE_COFFEE_COFFEE/blob/main/journal/Week7/Week7.md)

These two are formally part of the work, but were placed here (and linked to elsewhere, so not moved). 
They are based on the work of Timnit Gebru, Margaret Mitchell, et al to help data scientists create better models. 

* Week 8: [DataSheet](https://github.com/mrpotatocode/COFFEE_COFFEE_COFFEE/blob/main/journal/Week8/DataSheet-0.1.md)
* Week 12: [Model Card](https://github.com/mrpotatocode/COFFEE_COFFEE_COFFEE/blob/main/journal/Week12/ModelCard.md)
